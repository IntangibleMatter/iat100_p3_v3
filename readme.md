## Running

Make sure you have NPM installed, then download/clone this project to a
location of your choice. Once downloaded, open the project folder in a terminal
and run the following commands:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

If everything worked, then you should have the project running on
`localhost:9000` or something similar. Otherwise... good luck, I guess?
