Oh, it's easy, I lost to time
Got a fever of a hundred and I'm feeling alright
Made it outta life in prison without even a fine
Made it out with no convictions, I like to be bright

Oh, it's easy, I lost to time
Got a fever of a hundred and I'm feeling alright
Made it outta life in prison without even a fine
Made it out with no convictions, I like to be bright

I-I-I-I-I will find you in the nightlife
I-I-I will kill you in my next life
I-I sell the all new nine to five -i-i-i-ive
You stole just what I need
Attacking vertical

I give permission for the right price
I'm on a mission, gonna act right -right -right
Make no decision per the deadline
You got a valid fight attacking vertical
